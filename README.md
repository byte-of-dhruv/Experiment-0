Title - Introduction to Python

Aim - Learning about print function and variables.

Theory - The print() function is a built-in Python function used to display information on the output screen. It can print text (strings), numbers, variables, and results of expressions. The print function automatically moves the cursor to the next line after execution.

A variable in Python is a named memory location used to store data values. Unlike many programming languages, Python does not require explicit declaration of a variable’s data type. The data type is automatically assigned based on the value stored in the variable.

Algorithm- Program Using Print Function and Variables
1.Start
2.Initialize the required variables
3.Assign values to the variables
4.Use the print() function to display messages and variable values
5.Display the output on the screen
6.Stop


Conclusion - We learned about how to print strings, integers, float, etc. with string function.
